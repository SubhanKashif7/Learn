# variables are containers which store data temporarily in the memory

# variables in python are written like this

# in these myname and marks are variable and "Subhan" and 100 are data stored in these we will talk about datatypes soon

myname = "Subhan"

# you can make any variable of any name and you can also print it like this


print(myname)

# the output wil be "Subhan"
