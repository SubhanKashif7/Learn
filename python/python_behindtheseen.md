# How python works behind the seen

- Code Interpreted into Byte Code
- Byte Code into Python Virtual Machine
- Python Virtual Machine to Binary Code
- And then Executed By Computer

here is an AI explanation


Code interpreted into byte code: Python source code is first compiled into byte code by the Python interpreter. This byte code is platform-independent and can be executed on any system with a compatible Python interpreter.

Byte code into Python Virtual Machine (PVM): The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) is responsible for interpreting the byte code and executing it. It provides an environment where the byte code can be executed efficiently.

Python Virtual Machine to binary code: During execution, the PVM translates the byte code into machine code specific to the underlying hardware architecture. This is typically done through a process called just-in-time (JIT) compilation or interpretation.

Execution by the computer: Finally, the translated binary code is executed by the computer's CPU.
